## Coding Standards

- Use function declarations instead of arrow functions for utility functions and React components.
- Use `type` for defining TypeScript types and interfaces.
- Use single quotes for strings.
- Don't leave blank lines between JSX in React components.
- Inline component prop handlers unless they are used in multiple places within the same component.
